  "body": "## What is Shoestrap?\r\n\r\nShoestrap is a simple Python-based alternative to Chef and Puppet. It speaks Python so there's virtually no learning curve. This is a fork of https://github.com/cmer/shoestrap, because I don't like bash.\r\n\r\nYou should be able to get up and running in minutes, not hours.\r\n\r\n## What's wrong with Chef, Puppet and co.?\r\n\r\nChef and Puppet are great tools, but they are too complex for most use cases.\r\nThe learning curve for these tools is quite steep as they each have their own\r\nDSL. On the other end, Shoestrap is just Python. It does not require any\r\n'Python to config files' translation.\r\n\r\nI believe Shoestrap is a great simple alternative to Chef or Puppet that will\r\nfulfill the needs of most people.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nYou can see a sample cookbook at http://github.com/rockwotj/shoestrap.\r\n",
